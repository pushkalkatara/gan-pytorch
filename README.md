1. Non-convergence: the model parameters oscillate, destabilize and never converge,
2. Mode collapse: the generator collapses which produces limited varieties of samples,
3. Diminished gradient: the discriminator gets too successful that the generator gradient vanishes and learns nothing,
4. Unbalance between the generator and discriminator causing overfitting, and
5. Highly sensitive to the hyperparameter selections.
